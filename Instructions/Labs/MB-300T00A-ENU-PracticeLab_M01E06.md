## Exercise 6: Work with Saved views

1.  Navigate to **Modules**-\> **Product information management -\> Products -\> Release products.**
2.  You can see default view is “**Standard view**”.
3.  Select **Standard view** and then right click on the grid and select **insert column**.
4.  Select the columns you want to add and then select **Update**.
5.  You can now see that the “**Standard view” has an asterisk “\*”** appended to it. This indicates that a change has been made and can be saved into a view.
6.  Select the down arrow and then select **Save as**.
7.  Enter below details and then select **Save.**
-   In the “**Name**” field : enter a meaningful name for the view.
-   In the “**Description**” field : enter a long description that further defines the view.
-   You can enable the “**Pin as default view**” to pin the saved view as your default view. This means that the next time you navigate to this form this view will be the default view selected.
1.  View the **My view1**.

**Set A Default View**

1. Select the **My View1**, then click the view drop down and click the ellipses button (“…”).Click the “Pin as default” button to pin the view as the default view for the page

## Manage Views

*Once you have saved some views you are able to keep track of them using the manage views button.*

1. Click the views drop down and click the ellipses button and click the “**Manage my views**” button.

2. Select the view and then select **Pin as default** and select **Update**

3. Selected View should have pin attached to it.

4.Select the view and then select **Move up**

5.Select the View and then select **Move Down**.

6. Select **Rename** drop down and enter the name to view and then select **Save**. Select **Publish**.

7. Add a role to which people under the role the view gets published.

*Note: The publish feature is only available for those who have the “Saved views administrator” or “System administrator” security roles*

8. Select the view and then select **Delete** as shown below.

## Publish Views

*The publish views feature lets you publish a saved view to a security role. This means that any user that has that security role assigned will also be able to see the saved view you have published. This is a way that super users or power users can define how they want a form to look like for specific users and then standardize it so everyone has the same view.*

*1.* Click the “**Publish**” button in the “**Manage my views**” form or in the views drop down

2. In the section called “**Publish to people in these roles”** select the security roles that you want the view to be accessible to by clicking the “Add” button and selecting the security role(s).

3. In the “**Legal entity access**” section ,define if it should be available in specific legal entities or all legal entities and then select **Publish** and then select **Update**.

4. Assign the role and go back to the “**Released products**” form and click the views drop down and now see the saved view again because it was published to the security role that is now assigned to my user.
