## Exercise 6: Work with Saved views

1.  Navigate to **Modules** \> **Product information management \> Products \> Released products**. 

2.  You can see default view is **Standard view**.

3.  Right-click on the grid and select **Insert columns...**

4.  Select the columns you want to add and select **Update**.

5.  You can now see that the **Standard view** has an asterisk **“\*”** appended to it. This indicates that a change has been made and can be saved into a view. 

6.  Select **Standard view \*** and select **Save as...**. 

7.  Enter below details and then select **Save**. 

    - In the **Name** field: Enter a meaningful name for the view. 

    - In the **Description** field: Enter a long description that further defines the view. 

    - Optional: You can enable **Pin as default view** to pin the saved view as your default view. This means that the next time you navigate to this form this view will be the default view selected. 


**Set A Default View**

1. Open the view, then select the view drop-down and select the ellipsis **More** button (“…”). Select **Pin as default** to pin the view as the default view for the page. 


## Manage Views

*Once you have saved some views you are able to keep track of them using the manage views button.*

1.  Select the view name drop-down and select the ellipsis **More** button then select **Manage my views**. 

2.  Select the view and then select **Pin as default**. 

3.  The **(default)** text will move to the selected view. 

4.  To change the order, select a view and select **Move up** or **Move down**. 

5.  Select **Rename** drop-down and enter the name to view and then select **Save**.

6.  To remove a view, select the view and then select **Delete**. 

7.  Select **Cancel** to revert changes or **Update** to save. 


## Publish Views

*The publish views feature lets you publish a saved view to a security role. This means that any user that has that security role assigned will also be able to see the saved view you have published. This is a way that super users or power users can define how they want a form to look like for specific users and then standardize it so everyone has the same view.*

    > **Note:** The publish feature is only available for those who have the “Saved views administrator” or “System administrator” security roles.*

1.  Select the **Publish** button in the “**Manage my views**” form or in the views drop-down.

2.  In the **Publish to people in these roles** section, select the security roles that you want the view to be accessible to by selecting **+ Add** and selecting the security role(s).

3.  In the **Legal entity access** section, define if it should be available to specific legal entities or all legal entities, select **Publish** and then select **Update**.
