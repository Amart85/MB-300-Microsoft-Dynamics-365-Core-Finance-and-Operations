## Exercise 1: Create users and assign security roles

>   In this exercise, we will create two new users and assign security roles to
>   them. One will be manually entered, and one will be imported from the Azure
>   Active directory.

>   The HR department of **USMF** has requested access to Finance and Operations
>   apps for a newly hired employee as an **Accounts payable clerk**. As a
>   system administrator, you need to create a new user ID for the employee in
>   Finance and Operations, assign USMF as their default company, and associate
>   the **Accounts payable clerk**. The active directory user account has
>   already been created as part of the onboarding process.

>   You also need to import a new employee into Finance and Operations apps and
>   assign the default company to **USMF** and associate **Accounts receivable
>   clerk**.
