## Exercise 4: Create a purchase requisition workflow

>   The Finance and Operations app that you're working in determines the type of
>   workflow that you can create. You need either Internet Explorer or Microsoft
>   Edge to create the type of workflow and open the workflow editor. In this
>   exercise, you will create a purchase requisition workflow in USMF. Before a
>   purchase requisition can be submitted for review, you must configure a
>   workflow.
