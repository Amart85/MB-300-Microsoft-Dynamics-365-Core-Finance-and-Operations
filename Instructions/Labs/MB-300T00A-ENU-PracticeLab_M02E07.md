## Exercise 7: Set up number sequences

Number sequences are used to generate readable, unique identifiers for master
data records and transaction records that require them. A master data or
transaction record that requires an identifier is referred to as a reference.

Before you can create new records for a reference, you must set up a number
sequence and associate it with the reference. You can set up all required number
sequences at the same time by using the Set-up number sequences wizard, or you
can create or modify individual number sequences by using the Number sequences
page.
