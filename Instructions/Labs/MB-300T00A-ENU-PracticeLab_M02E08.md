## Exercise 8:  Create a Batch Job

As an administrator you need to create a batch job, which is a group of tasks that are submitted to an Application Object Server (AOS) instance for automatic processing.

### Task 1: Create the batch job

1.  Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar. 

2.  In the **System administration** module, go to **Inquiries** > **Batch jobs**.

3.  Select **+New**.

    - In the **Job description** field, enter `My Batch Job`

    - In the **Scheduled start date/time** field, enter todayâ€™s date.

4.  Select **Save**.


### Task 2: Create a recurrence

1.  In the menu bar pane, select **Batch job** > **Recurrence** in the legacy form, or **Recurrence** in the enhanced form. 

    - Use these options to enter a range and pattern for the recurrence desired. For example, select *daily* by choosing a pattern of **Days** and an interval of **1**. 

2.  Select **OK**.


### Task 3: Add alerts

1.  In the action pane, select **Batch job** > **Alerts** in the legacy form, or **Alerts** in the enhanced form. 

    - Indicate if you want alert messages sent when the batch job ends, has an error, or is canceled. Specify if you want the alerts to be displayed as pop-up messages or emailed. 

2.  Select **OK**. 


### Task 4: Copy a batch job

1.  Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar. 

2.  In the **System administration** module, go to **Inquiries** > **Batch jobs**. 

3.  Select the job that you want to copy, and in the action pane, select **Batch Job** > **Copy batch job** in the legacy form, or **Copy batch job** in the enhanced form. 

4.  Enter or add any changes. If you set **View tasks** to Yes, when you select **OK** you will go directly to the **Batch tasks** page for the copied job. 

    - The copied batch job will be created with a **Withhold** status, so you will need to enable it. The **Run by** user can also be set to give this user the privilege to run the job without being a system administrator. 


### Task 5: Enable the batch job

1.  On the **Batch job** page, in the action pane, select **Batch job** > **Change status** in the legacy form, or **Change status** in the enhanced form. 

2.  Select the **Waiting** status, and then select **OK**.


### Task 6: Set up active periods for batch jobs

1.  Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar.

2.  In the **System administration** module, go to **Setup** > **Active periods for batch jobs**.

3.  Select **+ New**.

4.  Enter a new period code, for example **Night**, the name of the period, and specify start and end times that the batch period is active.

5.  Select **Save**. 


### Task 7: Assign active periods to batch jobs

1.  Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar. 

2.  In the **System administration** module, go to **Inquiries** > **Batch jobs**. 

3.  Select the batch job that you want to assign a period to and select **Edit**. 

4.  In the **Active period** field, select the active period that you want to assign, and then select **Save**. 


### Task 8: Assign the Batch manager role to a user

1. Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar.

2. In the **System administration** module, go to **Security** > **Assign users to roles**. 

3. Select **Batch Job Manager** and under **Users assigned to role**, select **Manually assign / exclude users**. 

4. Choose a user from the list, and then select **Assign to role**. 

5. Close the page.
