## Exercise 8: Create an Organization Hierarchy and assign purpose

You can use organizational hierarchies to view and report on your business from
various perspectives. For example, you can set up one hierarchy for tax, legal,
or statutory reporting. You can then set up another hierarchy to report
financial information that is not legally required, but that is used for
internal reporting.

Before you create an organizational hierarchy, you must create organizations.
Use the following procedure to create an organizational hierarchy.

1.  Navigate to **Organization administration \> Organizations \> Organization
    hierarchies**.

2.  Select **+New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a value.

4.  Select **Assign purpose**.

5.  Select **+Add**.

6.  In the list, select the hierarchy you just created.

7.  Select **OK**.

8.  Select **View hierarchy**.

9.  Add organizations, as necessary. To add an organization, select **Edit** and
    then **Insert** to add the organization.

10. When you are done making changes, you can save a draft and/or publish the
    changes.
